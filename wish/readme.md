A script far too complicated for what it does x) 

Basically, it adds "[Author's note: the next paragraphs describes how your wish comes true.]" or 
"[Author's note: your hope will soon come true! The next paragraphs describe how your hope comes true.]" 
one line back during a few turns when the inputs contains "you wish" or "you hope".

See it in work on AID: 

Uses modules (https://github.com/myGat/AI-dungeon/tree/master/DevTool/modules/base) (Devon's modules with slight modifications), 
preciseMemory (https://github.com/myGat/AI-dungeon/tree/master/DevTool/modules/preciseMemory),
eventsHandler (https://github.com/myGat/AI-dungeon/tree/master/DevTool/modules/eventsHandler) and
wish (https://github.com/myGat/AI-dungeon/tree/master/DevTool/modules/wish). The script is "compilated" using 
my devtool on the folder "wish".
