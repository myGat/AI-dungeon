For now, this Folder contains nothing... Except the config files to show the capabilities of the devTool.

Assuming you copy the whole devTool folder, from the devTool folder in a terminal type :

node offlineVersion.js "modules/debugCommands"

This will create a folder "generated scripts" here, with the script you can copy on AID, 
containing the commandHandler and the modules. 

(Obviously, in some time this folder is intended to contain a module for commands 
useful to debug scenario)
