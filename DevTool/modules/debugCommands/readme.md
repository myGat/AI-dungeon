Assuming you copy the whole devTool folder, from the devTool folder, in a terminal, type :
```
node offlineVersion.js "modules/debugCommands"
```
This will create a folder "generated" here, with the script you can copy on AID, 
containing the commandHandler, the debug commands and the modules handler.
