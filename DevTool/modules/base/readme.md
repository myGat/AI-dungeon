A copy of the work of Devon: https://github.com/Devon7925/AID-Scripting

The shearedLibrary is into two files: sharedLibrary and sharedConfig. 
The sharedConfig contains only the list of mudules and settings - it's project-dependeant, 
so it's intended to be copied in your project, and filled with the relevant module and settings 
inside the project.
